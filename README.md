## The Challenge

In the tourism industry, data is generated rapidly from diverse sources ‚Äî flights, hotel bookings, and weather conditions. However, these data streams are often **isolated**, and analysis happens with significant **delay**.
 City planners, airlines, and hoteliers need **real-time insights** such as:

- Which cities currently attract the most tourists?
- What are the cancellation and delay rates for flights?
- When are the cheapest and least crowded travel periods?

To address these needs, a **real-time data pipeline** was designed to collect, process, and visualize live tourism data.

------

## The Solution

An **end-to-end streaming architecture** was implemented, integrating **Kafka**, **Spark Structured Streaming**, **Prometheus**, and **Grafana**.

- **Kafka** acts as a real-world simulator, generating live event streams:
  - `flight.events.v1` ‚Äì flight delays, cancellations, and departures
  - `weather.events.v1` ‚Äì real-time weather conditions
  - `booking.events.v1` ‚Äì hotel reservations and room prices
- **Spark Structured Streaming** ingests and processes these streams in real time:
  - Cleans and normalizes incoming data
  - Aggregates metrics using time windows (e.g., 1 minute, 30 days, 365 days).
  - Computes KPIs such as flight cancellation rate, average delay, hotel ADR, and total tourism spending

Spark‚Äôs **checkpointing**, **watermarking**, and **trigger mechanisms** ensure reliability and true streaming behavior even under network delays or data lags.

------

## Architecture

### üî∏ Components

- **Kafka** ‚Äì Event streaming backbone
- **Python Producers** ‚Äì Generate `flights`, `bookings`, `weather` events
- **Spark Structured Streaming** ‚Äì Clean, join, aggregate streams into KPIs
- **Prometheus + Pushgateway** ‚Äì Metrics collection from Spark
- **Grafana** ‚Äì Real-time dashboards (GeoMap, top cities, seasonal trends)

## Results & Impact

The Grafana dashboards transform raw real-time data into **actionable insights** for tourism analytics.
 Each visualization is powered by PromQL queries and custom legends, designed for clarity and fast decision-making across airports, cities, and seasons.

### 1. Airport Inbound & Outbound Traffic (Last 1 Minute)

**Queries:**
 `tourism_airport_flights_per_min{direction="inbound"}` and `tourism_airport_flights_per_min{direction="outbound"}`
 (aggregated using `sum without (instance, job)` and `topk(10)`)

**Purpose:**
 These horizontal bar charts highlight the **top 10 busiest airports** for incoming and outgoing flights over the last minute.
 They help operators quickly identify **traffic peaks**, **bottlenecks**, or **airport congestion** in real time.

**Example Use:**

- Airlines can dynamically allocate staff or gates based on current load.
- Tourism boards can track which cities are seeing sudden tourist inflows.

------

### 2. Total Flights per Minute (Stat Panel)

**Query:**
 `sum without (instance, job) (tourism_flights_total_per_min)`

**Purpose:**
 A simple **stat widget** showing the **total number of active flights per minute**, refreshed live.
 It serves as a **health indicator** for the entire flight data stream ‚Äî any sudden drop indicates a reporting delay or event disruption.

------

### 3. City Booking Leaderboards

**Queries:**

- `tourism_city_bookings_top{period="1m"}` ‚Üí last minute
- `tourism_city_bookings_top{period="30d"}` ‚Üí last 30 days
- `tourism_city_bookings_top{period="365d"}` ‚Üí last year

**Purpose:**
 These leaderboards display the **top 10 cities** by hotel bookings in different timeframes.
 Comparing 1-minute, 30-day, and 365-day views enables detection of **short-term surges** and **long-term travel trends**.

**Example Use:**

- Detect emerging tourist destinations (‚Äúsudden spikes‚Äù).
- Support marketing teams in **seasonal campaign planning**.
- Help hotel networks optimize pricing or staffing per city.

------

### 4. Real-Time Booking Heatmap (Geomap)

**Query:**

```
sum by (city_id, city_name, lat, lon) (tourism_city_bookings_geo)
```

**Purpose:**
 Plots each city as a live data point on the map, sized and colored by booking volume.
 It reveals **spatial patterns** in tourism activity ‚Äî such as regional concentration or demand shifts ‚Äî updated continuously.

**Example Use:**

- Detect live tourism ‚Äúhotspots‚Äù in Italy.
- Support **dynamic ad targeting** or **local event planning**.
- Monitor **impact of weather** or flight delays on regional booking distribution.

------

### 5. Monthly & Seasonal Rolling Trends

**Queries:**

- `tourism_month_bookings_rolling` ‚Üí monthly booking rhythm
- `tourism_month_spend_rolling_eur` ‚Üí monthly spending pattern
- `tourism_season_bookings_rolling` ‚Üí bookings by season
- `tourism_season_spend_rolling_eur` ‚Üí spending by season

**Purpose:**
 These bar and pie charts show **rolling 12-month and seasonal trends** in bookings and spending.
 They quantify **tourism seasonality**, helping to pinpoint the most and least profitable times of year.

**Example Use:**

- Estimate **high-season vs. off-season** performance.
- Correlate **weather and pricing** with tourist demand.
- Power the **Tourism Season Score** metric for data-driven travel recommendations.

### Why It Matters

Together, these dashboards turn continuous event streams into a **live tourism intelligence platform**:

| Stakeholder                | Value Gained                                                 |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **City Planners**          | Real-time visibility of tourism density and infrastructure load |
| **Airlines & Airports**    | Instant awareness of flight congestion and passenger flow    |
| **Hotels & Agencies**      | Live demand indicators for dynamic pricing and promotions    |
| **Researchers & Analysts** | Historical and live data for modeling travel patterns        |

By combining **Prometheus metrics**, **Grafana visualization**, and **Spark streaming analytics**, the system delivers **continuous situational awareness** ‚Äî enabling faster, data-driven decisions across the tourism ecosystem.
